![RETARD](fr.jpg "RETARD")

## Synopsis

This is the repository for a academic project created by [Robin H. van der Weide](https://robinweide.github.io/): **Re**pea**t**-**A**ssesment of **R**ibosomal **D**NA (**RETARD**). Here you will find all the code to prepare, run and analyse the results of RETARD.

## Motivation

Some cool applications could be healthy/tumor differences, quantification through time (aging) or the results of gene-loss accumulation.
